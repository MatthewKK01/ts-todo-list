5) ## Creating Handlers
    Handlers is the most popular option to create states by values user entered in input.

    I created some interface that takes two value first one is TaskName- which's type is String, and another one is Deadline - days of currect task, which is a number`s Type.

7) ## Clearing Input
    After user fills the data and creates a new task. input fields should be clear.
